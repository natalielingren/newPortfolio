      <h1>Project Goal</h1>
      <p>The goal of this tube top, is to design a versatile piece of clothing for Vancouverites that will fit well, look flattering, be sustainable and be a fair price. There are not many brands that fufill this requirement online.</p>

      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>My role in this project is to ensure the implementation of sustainable fabrics, and to oversee the iterations made from the user testing.</p>

      <h1>Execution</h1>
      <p>This project is launching the Summer 2018, but so far we have managed to secure a sustainable fabric made of lyocell and organic cotton. The first prototype is currently being made, and we have incoporated detachable straps because we found a large amount of our user base does not believe that a tube top alone would be supportive enough, and would stop them from buying it.</p>

      <h1>Outcomes</h1>
      <p>The wanted outcome of this project is really to create a clothing brand that breaks fast fashion, cheap, and as inlcusive as possible. With those brand elements, we want to push it forward in a way that incorporates a juxtaposition of tender vs tough and streetwear vs delicate.  </p>
