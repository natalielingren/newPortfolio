      <h1>Project Goal/Challenge</h1>
      <p>The Challenge of this project was to find a way to encourage public space activation in the winter. Our vision was to create a warm, inviting space where strangers could connect through playing and enjoying music. We wanted to offer  people a safe space to perform and play because we believe such spaces are lacking in Vancouver. We wanted to create a feeling of inclusion, inspiration, and joy through music at Patio Jams.</p>

      <h1>My Role</h1>
      <p>I was in charge of the user experience for the activation: Insuring that the space felt inclusive and welcoming for people of all musical skill levels, and that the layout and branding felt comfortable and safe. </p>

      <h2>The Design</h2>
      <p>Our team identified that musicians and music enthusiasts in Vancouver felt like they didn't have a comfortable place to casually place music outdoors in the winter. Our design had a warm toned colour palette, and the circular layout was to encourage collaboration, negating the idea of a "stage". The backyard patio vibe was decided to create a familar space for people that would encourage socialization.</p>

      <h1>Execution</h1>
      <p>Patio Jams successfully curated an open "jam" type event, with musicians of all skill level interacting and participating in playing music together. The community was brought together even in the cold to celebrate sharing music. The layout of the patio itself was successful in making people feel comfortable enough to interact and participate.</p>
