        </div>
        <p>Bridewarming was a challenge accepted by the cohort of students in SFU’s semester in Dialogue at CityStudio that I was enrolled in. It was an outdoor event held under the Cambie Bridge on November 24, 2017 where we aimed to explore the untapped potential and possibilities in Vancouver’s covered spaces.</p>

        <h3>The Goal of Patio Jams</h3>
        <p>Our vision was to create a warm, inviting space where strangers could connect through playing and enjoying music. We wanted to offer  people a safe space to perform and play because we believe such spaces are lacking in Vancouver. We wanted to create a feeling of inclusion, inspiration, and joy through music at Patio Jams.</p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Our vision was to create a warm, inviting space where strangers could connect through playing and enjoying music. We wanted to offer people a safe space to perform and play because we believe such spaces are lacking in Vancouver. We wanted to create a feeling of inclusion, inspiration, and joy through music at Patio Jams.
        </p>

        <h3>Process: Research</h3>
        <p>We looked at Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy, we connected our project to goals 7 and 10, which are “Cultivating Connections” and “Expressing Ourselves”, respectively. We identified that Vancouver has many barriers to perform music outdoors. Currently, the City of Vancouver requires event permits, block party permits, busking permits, and sound permits for musical activation. Without a permit, they ability to simply play music on City Property is limited to free busking zones such as on Robson Street and Transit stations. It can be difficult for community members to get together and enjoy music outdoors.

        <h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
        <h4>Project Notes</h4>
        <p>Patio Jams successfully curated an open "jam" type event, with musicians of all skill level interacting and participating in playing music together. The community was brought together even in the cold to celebrate sharing music. The layout of the patio itself was successful in making people feel comfortable enough to interact and participate.

        <h4>Patio Jams "ToolKit"</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Obtain a “Patio”
            <p>Elia Kirby at Arts Factory Society (778) 819-6805 created the 3 Piece Band.
              Possible alternative patio-like flooring can be sourced from patio tiles from local furniture stores and wooden planks that are obtainable from hardware stores.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Obtain patio furniture/ lights.
              <p>We outsourced furniture from friends and family.
                For flooring, we outsourced patio tiles and turf.
                As it is Winter season, it is easier to find patio furniture.

                Possible alternative furniture solutions can be sourced from local furniture stores. Party rental companies also rent furniture.We used Christmas lights sourced from friends and family.
                HFour Design Studio supplied us with some washlights.

                Lights can be rented from party rental companies.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Obtain instruments.
                <p>We rented from local stores such as Long &
                  McQuade. We recommend percussion instruments as they can be made by yourself, examples include shakers.

                  Invitations for people to bring their own instruments are highly encouraged.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Invite People!
                  <p>Most importantly, Patio Jams needs people. Invite your friends and people in your community. The space needs activators to engage in playing instruments and listening to music.</p></li>

                <h2>Unwanted Attention</h2>
                <h3>Project Context</h3>
                <p>I collaborated with Mischa Price and Taralyn Karras on this project. It is a commentary on the normalization of cat-calling, which is the instance
                  when a comment, usually from a far distance is relayed to a passerby. This attention is usually not welcome,
                  and can have a negative or insulting connotation or in contrast can come from a more positive and
                  complimentary place of mind. The passersby and people surrounding the piece will become the audience and
                  the viewers. </p>

                </div>
                  <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                  <p>The passersby and people surrounding the piece will become the audience and
                    the viewers. We are aiming to recreate the awkward feeling of either being on the receiving end of certain
                    comments, or being put in a situation of watching another person deal with these statements. The chaotic form
                    of this piece is a direct reflections of the seriousness of these idea. The different reactions of the audience
                    members will instigate different narration from the live performer on the other end of the speaker. If the
                    passerby chooses to either walk away, it will work into the concept of how this type of behaviour has become
                    extremely normalized. On the contrary, if the passerby chooses to attempt communication with the speaker
                    depending on distance from the piece, the audio will take different paths re creating different experiences.</p>
